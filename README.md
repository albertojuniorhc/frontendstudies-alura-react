# Chat based on Discord

This is a study project, based on Alura's Imers√£o React week.

The idea is to create a chat based on Discord layout.

# Project developed with:
- Next JS
- Skynexui
- Supabase

# To run the project:

You must install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

And run the project:

```bash
yarn dev
```

If you open the same URL on different tabs or computers, you will be able to chat in real time!
