# Chat based on Discord

This is a study project, based on Alura's Imers√£o React week.

The idea is to create a chat based on Discord layout.

[This project is hosted at Vercel!](https://alura-chat-snowy.vercel.app/)

# Project developed with:
- Next JS
- Skynexui
- Supabase

# To run the project locally:

You must clone this repository, install the dependencies and run!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/albertojuniorhc/nextjs-chat.git
yarn install && yarn dev
```

If you open the same URL on different tabs or computers, you will be able to chat in real time!
